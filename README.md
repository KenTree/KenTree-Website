# 🕸️ Kenneth's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website — a fully custom, React-powered experience built to showcase my projects, skills, and growth as a developer. This site is a living reflection of the work I’ve put in, both technically and creatively.

## 🚀 About This Project

This website was created not just as a portfolio, but as a **learning journey** to deepen my understanding of:

- ⚛️ **React.js** – component-based development and JSX syntax
- ⚡ **Vite** – ultra-fast builds and development workflow
- 🎨 **CSS Modules** – clean, scoped styling for component-based design
- 🌌 **Three.js / Vanta.js** – for animated, interactive 3D backgrounds
- 📦 **Open-source libraries** – like Vanta, React Router, etc.
- 🧪 **ESLint** – for maintaining clean and error-free code

Every line of code in this project is written with intention — I’ve avoided including anything I couldn’t explain or understand.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

- To **highlight my skills** in a polished, public-facing format
- To **practice React** and become confident building full-scale components
- To **explore new libraries** and expand my tech stack beyond the classroom
- To prepare for **software engineering internships and job opportunities**
